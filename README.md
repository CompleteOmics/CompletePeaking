# CompletePeaking

**CompletePeaking** is a collection of open-source tools developed by **CompleteOmics** for automated **peak detection and boundary assignment** in LCâ€“MS data.  

It currently includes:

- **[CompletePeaker-Metabolomics](./CompletePeaker-Metabolomics/)**  
  Peak boundary detection for LCâ€“MS **metabolomics** data.  
  Input: chromatogram CSVs â†’ Output: refined start/end boundaries.

- **[CompletePeaker-Proteomics](./CompletePeaker-Proteomics/)**  
  Machine learningâ€“powered peak picking for LCâ€“MS **proteomics** data.  
  Input: Skyline/mProphet CSVs + retention-time reference + XGBoost model â†’ Output: peptide-level boundaries.
